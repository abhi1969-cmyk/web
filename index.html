                Financial Inclusion is an important priority of the Government. The objective of Financial Inclusion is
                to extend financial services to the large hitherto un-served population of the country to unlock its
                growth potential. The Government initiated the National Mission for Financial Inclusion (NMFI), namely,
                Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana (PMJDY) in August, 2014 to provide universal banking services for every
                unbanked household, based on the guiding principles of banking the unbanked, securing the unsecured,
                funding the unfunded and serving un-served and under-served areas. With a view to further deepening the
                Financial Inclusion interventions in the country, PMJDY has been extended beyond 14.8.2018 with the
                focus on opening of accounts shifting from "every household" to "every unbanked adult".
